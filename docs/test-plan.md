# Test Plan & Strategy Document

**Project:** User Management Web Application  
**Tester:** Henna Jalwa, U.K  
**Date:** 29 July 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Testing Scope & Objectives

### 1.1 What is Being Tested
This test plan covers comprehensive testing of a user management web application consisting of:
- **Frontend:** React-based user interface for account management
- **Backend:** Node.js REST API for user CRUD operations
- **Integration:** End-to-end user workflows

### 1.2 Test Objectives
- Verify complete user registration and authentication flow
- Validate CRUD operations for user management
- Ensure proper error handling and validations
- Confirm API endpoint functionality and data integrity
- Test user interface responsiveness and usability

---

## 2. Test Coverage Areas

### 2.1 Functional Testing Coverage

#### UI Testing (Selenium WebDriver)
| Test Area | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **User Registration** | Valid user creation, Form validations | High |
| **User Authentication** | Valid login, Invalid credentials | High |
| **Profile Management** | View profile, Update user info | Medium |
| **User Deletion** | Account deletion, Confirmation dialogs | Medium |
| **Error Handling** | Network errors, Validation messages | High |

#### API Testing (Postman)
| Endpoint | Method | Test Cases | Priority |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| `/user/signup` | POST | Valid creation, Duplicate email | High |
| `/user/signin` | POST | Valid login, Invalid credentials | High |
| `/userInfo` | GET | Retrieve user details, Authentication | High |
| `/userInfo` | PATCH | Update user data, Validation | Medium |
| `/userInfo` | DELETE | Delete user, Cleanup verification | Medium |

### 2.2 Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance:** API response times (< 1 second target)
- **Security:** Input validation, Authentication tokens
- **Usability:** Form interactions, Error messaging
- **Compatibility:** Chrome browser support

## 3. Testing Tools & Framework Selection

### 3.1 Tool Selection Rationale

#### UI Automation: Selenium WebDriver + Java
**Why Chosen:**
- Industry standard for web UI automation
- Excellent cross-browser compatibility
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Strong integration with Java/Maven build systems
- Robust element identification strategies

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Cypress: Limited to Chrome-based browsers
- Playwright: Newer tool, less enterprise adoption

#### API Testing: Postman
**Why Chosen:**
- User-friendly interface for test development
- Easy test creation and management
- Built-in test scripting capabilities
- Environment management for different test stages
- Comprehensive reporting options
- Manual execution and collection runner support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- REST Assured: More coding-intensive
- Supertest: Requires Node.js application integration

#### Test Framework: TestNG
**Why Chosen:**
- Advanced test configuration and grouping
- Parallel test execution capabilities
- Detailed HTML reporting
- Flexible test ordering and dependencies
- Excellent Maven integration

## 4. Test Execution Strategy

### 4.1 Test Environment Strategy
```
QA Environment:
- UI: https://user-login-sys.netlify.app/
- API: https://user-login-mern-app.onrender.com/
- Browser: Chrome (latest stable)
- Data: Isolated test data for each run
```

### 4.2 Test Data Management
- **User Creation:** Dynamic test data generation
- **Authentication:** Dedicated test accounts
- **Cleanup:** Automated deletion after test completion
- **Isolation:** No shared data between test cases

### 4.3 Test Execution Approach

#### Sequential UI Testing
- Tests run sequentially to avoid data conflicts
- Each test creates and cleans up its own data
- Screenshot capture for failed test evidence

#### API Testing (Postman)
- Manual execution via Postman interface
- Collection runner for automated execution
- Independent data for each endpoint test
- Environment-specific configurations

## 5. Test Case Organization

### 5.1 UI Test Structure
```
UserCRUDTests.java (Consolidated approach)
├── testCompleteUserCRUDFlow()
├── testUserRegistration()
├── testProfileUpdate()
└── testUserDeletion()
```

### 5.2 API Test Structure
```
User API CRUD Test Suite (Postman)
├── Authentication Tests
│   ├── POST Create Account - Valid
│   ├── POST Login - Valid Credentials
│   └── POST Login - Invalid Credentials (Negative Test)
├── User Management Tests
│   ├── GET User Details
│   ├── PATCH Update User
│   └── DELETE User Account
└── Environment Configurations
    ├── QA Environment Variables
    └── Collection Variables (base_url)
```

## 6. Success Criteria & Metrics

### 6.1 Pass/Fail Criteria
- **UI Tests:** All critical user flows must pass (100%)
- **API Tests:** All endpoint operations must pass (100%)
- **Performance:** API responses < 1000ms (95th percentile)
- **Error Handling:** All validation scenarios handled correctly

### 6.2 Quality Gates
- Zero critical/high severity defects
- All test cases executed successfully
- Test evidence captured and documented
- Automated test execution without manual intervention

---

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 7.1 Identified Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Test Environment Unavailable | High | Low | Backup environment, API health checks |
| Browser Compatibility Issues | Medium | Low | Latest Chrome version, WebDriver updates |
| Test Data Conflicts | Medium | Medium | Isolated test data, cleanup procedures |
| API Rate Limiting | Low | Low | Throttled requests, retry mechanisms |

### 7.2 Assumptions
- Test environments remain stable during execution
- API endpoints maintain consistent response formats
- Chrome browser is the primary target for UI testing
- Test data can be created/deleted without restrictions

---

## 8. Deliverables & Reporting

### 8.1 Test Artifacts
- Automated test scripts (Selenium + Postman)
- Test execution reports (HTML format)
- Test data and environment configurations

### 8.2 Reporting Schedule
- **Real-time:** Test execution logs
- **Post-execution:** Consolidated HTML reports
- **Final:** Summary report with recommendations

---

## 9. Maintenance & Future Enhancements
